# Python-programming Intro and advanced
One repository with both the simpler exercises from the intro course and the exercises from the advanced course.

To navigate to my written code; select the desired file -> select the "src" folder -> select the .py file.
(The rest of the file is for testing the code, from the authors of the course)

To select the most difficult exercises, and thereby most complex code, select the folders with higher numbers.
